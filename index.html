    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I am a highly experienced management consultant having worked with clients across various
        industries including financial services, insurance, manufacturing, education, oil and gas among
        others. I have had the opportunity to play critical roles in market assessments, data collection and
        research, all while developing a strong foundation in statistical and strategic analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a skilled project analyst, I have gained invaluable experience in project management and
business analysis. Currently, I am involved in an array of exciting assignments, including a
performance management enhancement assignment for an FMCG company, a strategy
development and implementation project for a fintech, and a competency framework
development project for a leading fintech. My financial modeling capabilities and actuarial
background enable me to provide valuable insights to my clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from Strathmore University, which has further
bolstered my analytical skills and knowledge. Prior to joining Altima Africa, I gained hands-on
experience working as an intern in the operations department at ICEA Lion General Insurance
company.
    </p>
    <p>
        I take great pride in my diverse experience, comprehensive skill set, and unwavering commitment
to excellence. With these qualities, I am confident that I can provide significant value to any
organization that I work with.
